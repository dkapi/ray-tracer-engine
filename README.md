# ray-tracer-engine

<<<<<<< HEAD
planned features:
A camera with configurable position, orientation, and field of view
Anti-aliasing
Ray/sphere intersections
Ray/triangle intersections
The ability to load textures (file format(s) of your choice; may use third-party libraries)
Textured spheres and triangles
The ability to load and render triangle meshes (file format(s) of your choice; may use third-party libraries for loading)
A spatial subdivision acceleration structure of your choice
Specular, diffuse, and dielectric materials (per first volume of Ray Tracing in One Weekend series)
Emissive materials (lights)

possible featues to add:
High dynamic range images
Volume rendering (smoke, clouds, etc.)
Quads
Quadrics
Spectral rendering
BRDF materials (Bi-directional reflectance distribution functions)
Subsurface scattering (BSSRDFs)
Motion blur
Defocus blur/depth of field
Object instancing
Perlin noise
Cube maps
Importance sampling
Round pixels
Parallelization
Hybrid rendering with a GPU
GPU acceleration
Adaptive sampling
